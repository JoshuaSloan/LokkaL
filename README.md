# LokkaL
Senior Design Project - Group Location Sharing Mobile Application (Android)

## What is LokkaL?
LokkaL is a native Android application designed to allow users to seemlessly create, join and leave groups while share their location and battery life with other group members through a back-end MySQL database.

## Why LokkaL?
Whether attending a crowded concert or sporting event, or simply going out for a night on the town, our goal is to provide the security of knowing where family and friends are at all times so you never have to worry about losing each other.

While contacting others may be difficult is noisy environments, LokkaL automates the process of sharing your location so you never have to worry (regardless of how terrible someone may be at checking/answering their phone).

## More than just location
We have added functionality that allows you to see the battery life of your groups members, so you can meet up **BEFORE** someone's phone dies and you can no longer get a hold of them.

Take the worry out of your group experiences with LokkaL!
